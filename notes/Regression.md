# REGRESSION

Concepts to have clear 

* Irriducible error --> this leads to the fact that **not everything is learnable** --> Stocastic models vs. deterministic models.
* **Loss function**: quadratic loss and absolute error loss.
* **Risk function** or Expected Prediction Error. 
    * If we are using the quadratic loss the quantity that minimizes the risk function is the conditional expected value
    * If we are using the absolute error loss the quantity thath minimizes the risk function is the conditional median
