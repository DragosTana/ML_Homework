A scheme that can guide on when to use OLS, Ridge, Lasso, or Elastic Net:

1. Use **OLS** when there is no multicollinearity in the data. OLS is computationally efficient and produces unbiased estimates of the regression coefficients.

2. Use **Ridge** regression when there is high multicollinearity in the data. Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity by adding a penalty term to the cost function that shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero.

3. Use **Lasso** regression when there are a large number of features and some of them are likely to be irrelevant. Lasso regression can perform feature selection by setting some of the coefficient estimates to zero.

4. Use **Elastic Net** when there is both multicollinearity and a large number of features. Elastic Net is a combination of Ridge and Lasso regression and can handle both problems.
