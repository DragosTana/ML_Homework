# Statistical Learning assignments

During the course of statistical learning several homeworks were assigned. This repository contains both the code, the presentations and some sparse notes.

## Homework 1: Montecarlo Simulation

The objective of this homework was to use montecarlo simulation to verify a statistical property or behavior of our chosing. I decided to focus on the behaviour of the [Kolmogorov-Smirnov test](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_di_Kolmogorov-Smirnov), a non parametric test used to compare a sample with a reference probability distribution. I wanted to see how the behaviour of the test changes with respect to the sample distribution and sample size.

## Homework 2: Kernel density estimation and kernel regression

The objective of this homeowork was to understand the porpouse of the kernel methods and prepair a presentation on an interesting aspect. The presentation can focus on theory, applications, computation or simulation. My attention was focused on [kernel regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_regression) and its naive implementation
